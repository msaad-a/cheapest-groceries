Personal project still in progress. Using the selenium and pandas libraries to scrape data (allowed by terms of use) for grocery prices from supermarkets that allow for online shopping in Toronto. Current next steps:

- combine the data appropriately from the supermarkets using pandas
- allow users to perform a search in the console that will return product names which are close to the search terms (approximate string matching)
- returned products will be sorted from least expensive to most expensive
- will implement this later than the rest of what's included here, but eventually, set up a frontend to display this on a web app
